In This Release
===============

This file describes the code structure of Lanner platform status LED 
program.  This package provides program(DOS/Linux/FreeBSD) and driver
(Linux/FreeBSD) for Lanner platform-specific function.
Separated makefile available as well.(Makefile.dos, Makefile.linux, 
Makefile.freebsd)

For DOS environment, Use DJGPP as compiler., use DJGPP and Makefile.dos.

For Linux, supports kernel versions 2.4.x and 2.6.x and Makefile.linux. 

For FreeBSD, it is tested under FreeBSD 8.0. 

This release provide 2 ways(Defined in Makefile) to access Lanner platform
devices:

1. DIRECT_IO_ACCESS=0(Default):

   To access Lanner miscellaneous devices through lanner driver.
   Lanner driver is available in bin sub-directory after make.
   This driver is only supported as a loadable module at this time. Lanner is
   not supplying patches against the kernel source to allow for static linking
   of the driver.

   Note: This mode is enabled by set DIRECT_IO_ACCESS=0 in Makefile.

2. DIRECT_IO_ACCESS=1:

   To manipulate Lanner miscellaneous device by userland application direct
   accessing. This mode JUST FOR providing quick way for user to realize
   Lannner platform specific function. This mode supported on DOS and Linux.

   Note: This mode is enabled by set DIRECT_IO_ACCESS=1 in Makefile.



Building
========

To build, 3 steps to accomplish it:

1. Identify current OS and select proper Makefile. 
   Copy Makefile.(os) to Makefile.

2. Select access mode(DIRECT_IO_ACCESS=[0|1] by edit Makefile.

3. Just type make to build, once completed, bin sub-directory contains.



Installation
============

To installation, depend on what's access mode you set:

If DIRECT_IO_ACCESS=1, no driver is need. Just execute executable program in
bin sub-directory to manipulate LED function.

If DIRECT_IO_ACCESS=0 , driver is needed. 

For Linux:
	Insert module and create node in /dev as below example:
	#insmod sled_drv.[k]o
	#mknod /dev/sled_drv c 240 0

For FreeBSD:
	Insert module as below example:

	#kldload -v ./sled_drv.ko


Usage
=====
Once build completed, application(and driver) is available in bin sub-directory.
Just run "sled_tst" for Status LED test.
Note for Linux/FreeBSD user: insmod driver if necessary.
